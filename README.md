# Interview Test - Oireachtas Api

This project has a python module `oireachtas_api` which defines 3 functions to
load and process a couple of the [Houses of the Oireachtas Open Data APIs][1].

Specifically, they use the data obtained from the `legislation` and `members`
api endpoints to answer the questions:

* Which bills were sponsored by a given member ?
* Which bills were last updated within a specified time period ?

This task was assigned by an internship I was applying for at the time.

# Update: I have been offered the internship!
